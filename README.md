## REQUIREMENTS
Visual Studio Code will be used as the IDE for this project, though most any text editor will work for reproducing it. The project has the following dependencies:

-  Git
-  Python 3 environment with the following packages installed:
    -  Keras, Keras-RL, and Keras-Metrics; expansive open source library + addons for neural networks
    -  TensorFlow; suite of open source deep learning libraries
    -  OpenCV; open source image processing library
    -  PyGame; game engine for Python
    -  Numpy;  scientific math and computing

Installing a Python distribution and creating the environment will be done through [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/). To automatically create a flappy environment preconfigured with the correct dependencies for this project:

1.	Download the requirements file [environment.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WhitneyOnTheWeb/RL-Flappybird/master/environment.yml) to a `{path}` on your system
2.	Edit  environment.yml so prefix matches your Anaconda `\envs` path
3.	From *Anaconda Prompt* run:

    `conda env create -f {path}\environment.yml`

## EMULATION
There are several widely available opensource codebases in existence that emulate Flappy Bird and provide all necessary assets. This project will utilize a popular clone [FlapPy Bird](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird), built in Python using pygame and available on GitHub under the MIT License , which provides all functionality and should require relatively little code modification to make it suitable for an RL agent.

1.	From a command terminal cd to the project directory and run:

    `git clone https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird.git`

2.	All graphics are located in the `\assets` folder
3.	The game can be launched by running `flappy.py` from your Python terminal 
4.	The **â†‘** or **Space** keys are used to flap in lieu of tapping on the screen
